# Pomodoro Timer

## Description
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

Typically, each routine consists of 8 sessions, involving 4 work sessions, 3 short breaks and 1 final long break. This project is my implementation of the same.

## Installation
* Make sure that you have python3 installed in your system

* Install the tkinter module for python using pip <br />
      ```  pip install tk```

* Clone this repository <br />
   ```  git clone https://github.com/Shambu-K/Pomodoro-Timer.git```
   
* Run the python file <br />
   ```  python3 main.py```

* In case you wish to try the app without going through the process of installation, simply run the executable named **timer**

## Usage

* Click on the **Start** button to start the timer
* Click on the **Reset** button to reset the timer

**Note:** Start button should be pressed only in the beginning or after the timer has been reset, otherwise the program will glitch.

P.S. I know the GUI looks terrible. I probably won't improve it, so feel free to make PRs.
